# This defaults file contains both JJB variables and project configuration
# stanzas which apply to all jobs that do not have an alternate "defaults:"
# declaration.
#
# JJB variables are values that get interpolated into templates and shell
# scripts where ever that variable appears through  JJB yaml & shells scripts in
# the form of {varnam}.
#
# JJB project configuration is actual JJB declaration of some built-in Jenkins
# job feature or plugin and the attributes necessary to get the desired
# behavior our of that plugin/feature.
#
# In this file the distinction between "JJB variable" and "JJB project
# configuration" is made by the presence of a line comment with "# VAR" above
# the description of that variable.
